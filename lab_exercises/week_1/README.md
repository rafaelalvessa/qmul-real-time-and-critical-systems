# Lab Exercise Week 1

## Introduction to Keil Î¼Vision

The Freedom board includes a multi-colour LED (which is a red, green and blue
LED in a single package). The program flashes each in turn, with a delay between
them.

The goal is to change the delay and light up multiple LEDs.

If all three colours are alight together the LED appears white. Three other
colours are possible by lighting two out of the three LEDs. Flash them in a
pleasing sequence.
